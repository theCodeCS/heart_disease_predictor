# Predicting Heart Disease in Patients

## Description:

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on numerous factors. The model is trained on a dataset of patient data and uses a number of features to make its predictions. The model is trained using a number of different machine learning algorithms and the best performing model is selected for use in the final application.

We will include sql queries in addition to python code to show how we can analyze the data using SQL as well as utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease.
